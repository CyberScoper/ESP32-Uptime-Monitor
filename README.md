🚀 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP32-Uptime-Monitor.git

2️⃣ Open in Arduino IDE / PlatformIO

Open main.ino in Arduino IDE.

Install required ESP32 board support from the Boards Manager.


3️⃣ Set Up SPIFFS Filesystem

To upload index.html to SPIFFS:

Install the ESP32 Sketch Data Upload Plugin:

Download: ESP32 SPIFFS Tool

Extract & place it into:

Windows: C:\Users\<YourUser>\Documents\Arduino\tools

Mac/Linux: ~/Arduino/tools/


Restart Arduino IDE.

Go to Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload to upload files.



4️⃣ Modify config.json

Edit config.json inside the /data/ folder before uploading:

{
  "wifi_ssid": "Your_WiFi_Name",
  "wifi_password": "Your_WiFi_Password",
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://arduino.cc",
    "https://google.com"
  ],
  "interval": 30
}

5️⃣ Upload the Firmware

Select your ESP32 board in Tools > Board

Choose the correct COM port

Click Upload 🚀
